# Botpress assessment

Hello reviewer :)!

This is my solution for the assessment provided to me.

# Solution
I decided to use node.js with express and typescript for the backend and React
and typescript for the frontend since those are the technologies that I am most
familiar with in the node.js world. The connection between and React frontend
and the backend is made with the help of socket.io to allow the server to notify
the frontend of any changes that happened with the files.

I followed the MVC archiecture with a sprinkle of Clean Architecture for the
obvious decoupling benifits.
